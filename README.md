# GIBBS SAMPLING METHOD TO FIND MOTIF

Utilising Gibbs Sampling, this Python programme implements a theme discovery technique. The system searches through protein sequences entered by the user for a common pattern.

Following is how the Gibbs Sampling algorithm operates:
Set the motifs in each sequence to random positions at the beginning.
Update each motif's position iteratively using a profile made from of the other motifs.
Up to convergence (no change in locations).
